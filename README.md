# Qtile

So this is a repo for me to hack and test stuff.
IDK might contribute if I ever get smart enough.

## Setup

General setup like the docs say.
Using pyenv system, since it is running on system python.
Also check for Xephyr.

```bash
./scripts/ffibuild

./dev.sh
```

## Running with my configs

Use `scons -Q test-config`
